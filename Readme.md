# Projecting external data onto Stemformatics atlases

This repository contains examples which show how data may be manipulated before projection onto the integrated atlases at [Stemformatics](http://stemformatics.org).
These examples were also used in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.05.543705).

Note that data/ directory referred to in the notebooks are not included here due to file size and repository size limits, but the notebook describes in detail how each input files were obtained and the URLs used to download the published data from.

output/ directory contains .html and .py versions of the notebook. By downloading this directory alone and opening the html file in your browser, you can read the content of the jupyter notebook without running it.
